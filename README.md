Tasks Performed :


Data Visualization and Tool Utilization -  The first step involves extracting data from the HR Attrition Excel file. Subsequently,we identify whether static or interactive visualizations are more appropriate for the given context. Additionally, we introduce and apply emerging visualization tools and techniques, considering factors such as layout, colors, and interactive features. Audience identification and determining the level of detail required for visualization, including drill-down and grouping, will be crucial. Decisions on color schees and layout will also be made, all of which will be detailed in a 2-page report.

 
Review of Project Data Set - This involves identifying the total volume of data and analyzing its diversity based on factors such as job role, age group, and education. We use a variety of data visualization methods to portray patterns, trends, and correlations effectively. A 2-page report will be prepared, explaining each aspect with justifications.


Selection of Visualization Techniques - For this activity, we will select one or more data visualization techniques, such as Line Charts, Word Clouds, Network Diagrams, Bar Charts, Scatter Plots, or Pie Charts, based on the project requirements.
 
 
PowerBI Dashboard Development -  In the final activity, The focus will be on creating dashboards and scorecards with advanced visualization techniques. We will embed analytics capabilities into the visualizations to allow for interactive exploration and analysis of the data. The project report will include a weblink to the PowerBI project with visualizations, and a snapshot of the visualizations will be attached as an annexure.
